1. Overview of the Project - I have created a input field using textarea and three buttons Run, Save , Clear,  on clicking on run the querry will get executed and you see the result in form of table, and if you click on save then it will get saved in saved queries section and on pressing clear it will clear text area,

I have used static data for this so ,I have three queries and three table according to those queries, you can select any query from saved queries or queries history and click on run and the result will be visible.

4.Optimizations to decrease load time and increase performance time -

1.I have made this website responsive so that it can perform well in any size of screens

2.There is so major dependecies are used that would hamper the performance of website.

3.I have hosted this on vercel which provided free ssl certificates and increase security.

4.I have use PWA(Progressive Web Apps) to optimize it.
